***

| Name | Description | Open Source? | Supported Platforms |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| [Inertia](https://inertiaclient.com/Index.php) | Formerly known as *WWE*, Inertia is a very strong contender for new player use, with a simple and clean GUI. Can be used standalone for sure.| No | Fabric, Jarmod |
| [KAMI](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/KAMI/releases)|Not to be confused with [KAMI Blue](https://kamiblue.org), a 1.12.2 Utility mod, KAMI is a 1.16 remake of the original KAMI, and one of the most promising clients coming up. Currently it is lacking some features, but in the future this will be a very powerful client. | [Yes](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/KAMI)| Fabric only |
| [Meteor](https://meteorclient.com/)| Meteor is a long-developed latest version client, boasting strong PVP and some Anarchy bypasses. The GUI is clean, and the client is more than functional. This will most likely be one of the most used clients aside KAMI later down the line. | [Yes](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client)| Fabric only|
| [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/)| The name fits the bill. This client is nearly unusable, with no bypasses and no customizabilty. Mostly used by new players for Xray alone. Offers no PVP options. Only pros are fast at updating to the latest version and good for singleplayer. Avoid if possible. | [Yes](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7)| Fabric only |
| [Impact](https://impactclient.net/)| The legendary client, Impact is a very beginner freindly client, featuring large amounts of customizabilty, and a slick GUI. Currently Impact for 1.16.5 is in a Donator-only beta ($5). A Highly useful client, best paired with another (not possible on 1.16). | No | Jarmod only|
| [Ares](https://aresclient.org/)| Ares is a strong contender in the PVP scene, and while not a full use client, is a strong addon to most setups. A very simple GUI, and very easy to use. | [Yes](https://github.com/AresClient/ares) | Fabric only |
| [Sigma](https://sigmaclient.info/) | Sigma is a standalone client (No other mods can be combined) specifically for Minigame bypasses. While it is an aesthetically pleasing client, A lack of Anarchy modules and many useful features behind a $20 paywall, Sigma is not a good option. | No | Version files
| [BleachHack](https://bleachhack.github.io/)| A rather odd addition, BleachHack is a surprisingly useful client, with full-use mods and active development. A very promising client, with very simple configuration. | [Yes](https://github.com/BleachDrinker420/BleachHack) | Fabric only |
| [Aristois](https://aristois.net/) | Aristois is comparable to Inertia, but has fewer bypasses, and more modules geared towards automation. Can put fabric mods in your .minecraft/libraries/me/deftware/EMC-F-v2/(version) that will initialize on launch. | No | Launcher profile installer
| [Cornos](https://cornos.cf) | Cornos is an overall good quality client. It has GUI modules like Wurst's, and some additional inside jokes as well. It features TheAltening authentication and a huge amount of modules, as well as a working server crasher. It does lack AutoCrystal and other Anarchy client features, though. | [Yes](https://github.com/AriliusClient/Cornos) | Fabric only |
