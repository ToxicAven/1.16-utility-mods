| Name | Description | Open Source? |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| [Inertia](https://inertiaclient.com/Index.php) | Formerly known as *WWE*, Inertia is a very strong contender for new player use, with a simple and clean GUI. A very strong contender, and can for sure be used standalone.| No |
| [KAMI](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/KAMI/releases)|Not to be confused with [Kami Blue](), a 1.12.2 Utility mod, KAMI is a latest version remake of the original KAMI, and one of the most promising clients coming up. Currently it is lacking some features, but in the future this will be a very powerful client. | [Yes](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/KAMI)|
| [Meteor](https://meteorclient.com/)| Meteor is a long-developed latest version client, boasting strong PVP and some Anarchy bypasses. The GUI is clean, and the client is more than functional. This will most likely be one of the most used clients aside KAMI later down the line. | [Yes](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client)|
| [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/)| The name fits the bill. This client is nearly unusable, with no bypasses and no customizabilty. Mostly will not be used, or used by new players for Xray alone. Offers no PVP options. Only pro is fast updating to the latest version. Avoid if possible. | [Yes](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7)|
| [Impact](https://impactclient.net/)|The legendary client, Impact is a very beginner freindly free client, featuring large amounts of customizabilty, and a slick GUI. Currently Impact for 1.16.5 is in a Donator-only beta ($5). A Highly useful client, best paired with another. | No
| [Ares](https://aresclient.org/)| Ares is a strong contender in the PVP scene, and while not a full use client, is a strong addon to most setups. A very simple GUI, and very easy to use. | [Yes](https://github.com/AresClient/ares)
| [BleachHack](https://github.com/BleachDrinker420/bleachhack-1.14/releases)| A rather odd addition, BleachHack is a surprisingly useful client, with full-use mods and active development. the only gripe that makes me say this is best paired with another client is the Render modules. | [Yes](https://github.com/BleachDrinker420/bleachhack-1.14)
